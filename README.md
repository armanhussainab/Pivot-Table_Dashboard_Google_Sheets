This Quarterly Sales Team Performance Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales activities and outcomes. It highlights key performance indicators such as the total number of opportunities won and the overall win/loss rate. The dashboard features visualizations including a donut chart representing win/loss percentages and a bar chart ranking sales agents by opportunities won, offering a clear view of top performers. While these visuals primarily display a static snapshot of Q4 data, the dashboard is further supported by detailed pivot tables that break down performance by deal stage, sales agent, and quarter, covering the full calendar year of 2017. This structure enables both high-level insights and in-depth analysis, although aligning the main visuals with the full-year data would enhance consistency and analytical value.
